Customizing Bash
We'll customize our bash prompt by downloading a bashrc file from our content repository and placing it our /home/anon directory. This command will download the file, rename it, and place it in the proper directory:
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-python3-sysadmin/master/helpers/bashrc -o ~/.bashrc
Customizing Vim
Like we did with the bashrc, we'll customize Vim by downloading a vimrc file with this command: 
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-python3-sysadmin/master/helpers/vimrc -o ~/.vimrc
